Will You Be The Fiona To My Shrek?
A simple and fun way to ask your crush out on a date, with a "Shrek" and "The Office" twist. This project displays a question with "Yes" and "No" buttons. The "No" button will dodge the user's cursor, making it impossible to click. When the user clicks "Yes", a pop-up appears with a themed message, GIFs, and a Spotify playlist.

About The Project
This project was created to be a cute and memorable way to ask someone on a date. It's built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it's easy to customize and personalize.

The key features are:

A "No" button that's impossible to click: The "No" button uses JavaScript to move to a random position on the screen whenever the user's mouse hovers over it.

A "Yes" button that reveals a surprise: When the "Yes" button is clicked, a pop-up appears with a custom message, images, and an embedded Spotify playlist.

A "Shrek" and "The Office" theme: The project is themed around Shrek and The Office, with a swamp background, a custom font, and themed messages and images.
