Will You Be The Fiona To My Shrek? ðŸ’š
A fun, interactive, and personalized webpage to ask that special someone out on a date, inspired by the magic of Shrek and the romance of The Office.

About The Project
This project was created as a unique and heartfelt way to ask a very important question. It's designed to be a delightful surprise, combining personal inside jokes with a playful interactive element.

The core concept is simple but effective:

The user is presented with a question and two choices: "Yes" or "No".

The "No" button is cleverly coded to dodge the mouse cursor, making it impossible to click. This ensures the outcome is always positive!

Once the "Yes" button is clicked, a celebratory pop-up appears, revealing a custom message, themed GIFs, and a specially curated Spotify playlist to set the mood.

The entire page is themed around a love for Shrek and The Office, creating a personalized experience that's sure to make them smile.

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, you only need a web browser.

Prerequisites
No special software is needed!

Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git

Navigate to the project folder and open the index.html file in your favorite web browser.

How It Works
The user experience is straightforward and fun:

The page loads with the main question: "Will you be the Fiona to my Shrek?".

If the user tries to move their mouse over the "No" button, it will jump to a new random position on the screen.

When the user clicks the "Yes" button, a pop-up appears.

The pop-up displays the Dwight Schrute-inspired message: "Fact: Bears eat beets. Ogres go on dates.", along with a happy Shrek GIF and a romantic Jim & Pam GIF.

Below the GIFs, an embedded Spotify playlist is ready to be played.

Customization
It's very easy to personalize this project for your own special someone!

Change the main question: Open index.html and edit the text inside the <h1> tag.

Change the pop-up message: In index.html, find the div with the class popup and edit the text inside the <h2> tag.

Change the GIFs: In the same popup div, change the src attribute of the <img> tags to the URL of any other GIF you'd like to use.

Change the Spotify Playlist:

Go to the Spotify playlist you want to use.

Click the ... button next to the playlist title.

Go to Share -> Embed playlist.

Copy the <iframe> code provided by Spotify.

Paste this code into index.html, replacing the existing <iframe> element.

Change the background and colors: All styling, including the background image, colors, and fonts, can be modified in the style.css file.
