# Will You Be The Fiona To My Shrek? ðŸ’š

A fun, interactive, and personalized webpage to ask that special someone out on a date, inspired by the magic of Shrek and the romance of The Office.

## About The Project

This project was created as a unique and heartfelt way to ask a very important question. It's designed to be a delightful surprise, combining personal inside jokes with a playful interactive element.

**Core Concept:**

- The user is presented with a question and two choices: "Yes" or "No".
- An animated night sky with a moon, twinkling stars, and falling stars sets a magical mood.
- The "No" button dodges the mouse cursor, making it impossible to clickâ€”so the answer is always "Yes"!
- Clicking "Yes" triggers a celebratory pop-up with a custom message, themed GIFs, and a curated Spotify playlist.
- The page is themed around Shrek and The Office for a personalized, smile-inducing experience.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run locally, all you need is a web browser.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
  ```
2. Open the project folder and double-click `index.html` to launch in your browser.

## How It Works

- The main question appears over a beautiful, animated night sky: "Will you be the Fiona to my Shrek?"
- Hovering over "No" makes it jump away from the cursor.
- Clicking "Yes" opens a pop-up with:
  - A Dwight Schrute-inspired message: "Fact: Bears eat beets. Ogres go on dates."
  - A happy Shrek GIF and a romantic Jim & Pam GIF.
  - An embedded Spotify playlist.

## Customization

Personalize for your own special someone:
- **Main question:** Edit the `<h1>` tag in `index.html`.
- **Pop-up message:** Edit the `<h2>` tag in the popup div.
- **GIFs:** Change the `src` of the `<img>` tags in the popup.
- **Spotify playlist:** 
  1. Find your playlist on Spotify.
  2. Click `...` > Share > Embed playlist.
  3. Copy the `<iframe>` code and replace the existing one in `index.html`.
- **Styling:** Edit `style.css` for backgrounds, colors, and fonts.
